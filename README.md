# Â¡WEB SITE OF CARLOS ARROYO!

## My personal Blog, enter and discover mi world.

Website developed with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**, adhering to **semantic tags** for optimal **SEO**. The styles are crafted in CSS, and some button functionalities are implemented with JavaScript. The project began with a wireframe sketch created in **Figma**.

The project was completed in one month from scratch, without prior knowledge of the languages used, and was designed with a minimalist aesthetic in two versions: **light mode and dark mode** with neutral tones and neon colors for a modern interface. It is also **responsive**, adapting to any screen size and device.

In **PageSpeed Insights** performance tests, the project **scored 96** in performance and 100 in SEO, demonstrating a structure optimized for the web. Although loading large images on mobile can slightly slow down performance, the site remains efficient and well-structured.

All project files are stored in a GitHub repository and connected to Visual Studio Code for a smooth workflow. The site is hosted on **Netlify**, which manages the domain and automatically deploys updates from the repository.

This project represents a strong learning experience and marks the first website developed by me, integrating concepts of accessibility, user experience, and best practices in web development.
